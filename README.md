# QuickSort Java Implementation

## Summary
This repository contains a simple Java implementation of the QuickSort algorithm. The QuickSort algorithm is a widely used sorting algorithm known for its efficiency and speed. The code is structured in a single `main` class, and it includes methods for generating an array of random integers, performing the QuickSort algorithm, and auxiliary methods for partitioning and swapping elements.

## Details
The QuickSort algorithm is a comparison sort that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort an array efficiently. The quickSort method in the main class implements the QuickSort algorithm, and the partition and swap methods are helper methods used in the algorithm.
